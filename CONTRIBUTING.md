# Contributing to Nomi

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nomi!

Firstly, we recommend you join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/qRD5XEJKc4) to be able to talk with [main developers](./README.md#main-developers).

After all, you need to find an interesting issue or create one.
If the issue already exists, you need to leave a comment and check if someone has already worked on it. If it is, you may ask to join.
If there's no issue. You must create one and wait until someone from the [main development team](./README.md#main-developers) comments on it and accepts it. Then you can start contributing.

### Some simple rules

1. The name of your issue/PR should be useful for other users
    - good name: Implement Fabric launching, Fix `MISSING assets` error
    - bad name: Fabric, assets, good issue
2. If your code looks more complex than you expected, leave comments in it to explain what it does.
3. Write a description for your issue/PR that explains what it solves/adds
